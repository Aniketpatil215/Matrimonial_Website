 EXISTING MANUAL SYSTEM 
 The feature of existing system is that searching a good life partner in this world is the 
times Consuming and cost effective. Online matrimonial system is used to overcome these 
drawbacks. Already existing system contains the details of Grooms/Brides as updated.
For eg. Name, religion, Salary etc. In Existing system, there is possibilities of creating 
fake accounts. The fake account creation has been done mainly by skipping out the screen 
without entering the OTP which has been received by the given number


 LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING SYSTEM
1. The drawback of this application is that it doesn’t allow the interested individuals to 
chat.
2. This leads to sharing of critical information like Contact no, Address and other personal 
details.
3. Privacy is the biggest concern when it comes to matrimonial apps. Privacy of one’s 
information can be hampered once it goes online like too much person information 
personal and office address, salary, details, amongst other.
4. Even when matrimonial websites help in starting a Conversation before marriage but 
still by more chatting and not meeting each-other personally one cannot figure out of 
what type the other person actually is.

other go-betweens. However, with times changing, they have started registering at
different matrimonial websites.
4. Let’s learn a few things more things about how such online matrimonial sites can help
you choose the partner of your dreams.


 Methedology

To design computerized system, we have to follow the software engineering approach. 
We have chosen classic life cycle approach for software development. This phenomenon 
includes system design, system analysis and testing. Which is followed by again first that is 
repeating the cycle.
System design means understanding the old system completely and planning a new 
system or to completed and planning a new system or to replace or completed the existing 
system. System analysis means identification, understanding and critically examine the 
system and its part (sub system) for the purpose of achieving the goals set of the system as a 
whole, through modification, change interrelationship of components. the
The methodology of system analysis involves,
1. Identification of system (setting the system boundaries).
2. Understanding the role and interrelationship of element of the same system.
Outcome of the system analysis job is a set of recommendation towards creating system, 
which best meets, its objectives giving due regards to cost effectiveness and risk.

                      5. ADVANTAGES OF PROPOSED SYSTEM 
                      
 The main advantage of this application is that it makes the search easy for 
those who are interested for marriage.
 It allows individual to set priorities and thus helps to view profiles according 
to their priorities set.
 This avoids the overhead of meeting face to face just to know about the basic 
information, which now the user can view online.
 You can shortlist the profiles according to your preference and forward those
profiles to your relatives. And relatives will view the profiles which you send
through the mail. This is one of the major advantages of matrimonial sites.
 Leave your dream world and find your soul mate in real. Don’t think that your
partner will come automatically and knock on your door. Never trust in this
type of coincidence, make your efforts and find the special one. Here you will
get bunches of attractive registered brides and grooms. And after choosing one
you can contact that particular individual.
 Relatives can’t bring you thousands of perspectives of the bride and groom. In 
the best scenario, matrimonial sites go best to you where you can get lots of 
options. What you only need is just register yourself to the matrimonial site 
and get thousands of matrimonial profiles for you.

                             7. About java 
                             
Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by James Gosling and 
Colleagues at Sun Microsystem in early 1990s. Unlike conventional languages which are 
generally designed either to be compiled to native code, or to be interrupted from source 
code at runtime, Java is intended to be compiled to a byte code, which is then run (generally 
using JIT compilation) by a Java Virtual Machine. 
 Java was started as a project called “oak” by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling goals 
were to implemented a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but 
with greater uniformly and simplicity then C and C++. The first public implementation was 
Java 1.0 in 1995. It made the promise of “Write Once, Run Anywhere”, with free runtimes on 
popular platforms. It was fairly secure and its security was configurable, allowing for 
network and access to be limited. The major web browsers soon incorporated it into their 
standard configuration in secure “Applet” configuration popular quickly. New versions for 
large and small platforms (J2EE and J2ME) soon were designed with the advent of “Java 2”. 
Sun has not announced any plans for a “Java 3”.

                    8.  ABOUT JAVA NET BEANS IDE 8.2
                    
The Net Beans Platform is a framework for simplifying the development of 
Java Swing desktop applications. The Net Beans IDE bundle for Java SE contains what 
is needed to start developing Net Beans plugins and Net Beans Platform based 
applications no additional JDK is required. 
Applications can install modules dynamically. Any application can include the 
Update Centre module to allow users of the application to download digitally signed 
upgrades and new features directly into the running application. Reinstalling an upgrade 
or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again. 
 The platform offers reusable services common to desktop applications, allowing 
developers to focus on the logic specific to their application. Among the features of the 
platform are: 
Net Beans IDE is an open-source integrated development environment. Net Beans 
IDE supports development of all Java application types (Java SE (including Java FX), 
Java ME, web, EJB and mobile applications) out of the box. Among other features are 
an Ant-based project system, Maven support, refactoring, version control (supporting 
CVS, Subversion, Mercurial and Clear case).

                               9.  Modularity
                               
All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules. Each module provides a 
well- defined function, such as support for the Java language, editing, or support for the 
CVS versioning system, and SVN. Net Beans contains all the modules needed for Java 
development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately. 
Modules also allow Net Beans to be extended. New features, such as support for other 
programming languages, can be added by installing additional modules.
 For instance, Sun Studio, Sun Java Studio Enterprise, and Sun Java Studio Creator 
from Sun Microsystems are all based on the Net Beans IDE .
 Licence
From July 2006 through 2007, Net Beans IDE was licensed under Sun's Common 
Development and Distribution License (CDDL), a license based on the Mozilla Public 
License (MPL). In October 2007, Sun announced that Net Beans would henceforth be 
offered under a dual license of the CDDL and the GPL version 2 licenses, with the GPL 
linking exception for GNU Class path

 WHAT IS DATABSASE
 A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has 
one or more distinct Application for creating, accessing managing, searching and replicating the 
data it holds. 
Other kinds of data stores can be used such as files on the file system or large hash tables 
in memory but data fetching and writing would not be fast and easy with those types of systems. 
So now a day we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) 
TO store and manage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data 
is stored into different bales and relations are established using primary keys or other keys 
known as foreign keys.
 A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDMS)
 Enables you to implement a database with tables, columns and indexes. 
 Guarantees the Referential Integrity between rows of various tables. 
 Updates the indexes automatically. 
 Interprets a MYSQL query and combines information from various tables.

                             11. MySQL DATABASE
MySQL Server Management Studio
MySQL is a relational database system that is used to store information. MySQL can store 
many types of data from something as tiny as a single character to as large as complete files or 
graphics. Although it can be accessed by most programming languages, it is often coupled with 
PHP because they work together with ease.
Information stored in a MySQL database hosted on a web server can be accessed from 
anywhere in the world with a computer. This makes it a good way to store information that needs 
the ability to change over time, but also needs to be accessed over the net. Some examples that 
can utilize MySQL are a web message board or a customer's shipping status. 
MySQL is a database system used on the web. Basically, a MySQL database allows to 
create a relational database structure on a web-server somewhere in order to store data or 
automate procedures. If we think of it in comparison to Microsoft Access, MySQL is what holds 
all of our tables, JSP acts as our queries (among other things), and our forms are basically web 
pages with fields in them. With all of this combined, we can create truly spectacular projects on 
the web. 
MySQL is also open source in that it’s free and falls under the GNU General Public 
License (GPL). Chances are, if we are getting our own web-page or already have one – our host 
supports MySQL and JSP. They are generally associated with (though not limited to) Unix/Linux 
based servers. If by chance we are considering getting our own page and want MySQL and JSP 
support, check out Dreamhost – I’ve been using them for years and they absolutely can’t be beat.

                      14. CONCLUSION 
  
  
  
After designing and implementation of this system we have come to the
followingconclusion.
1.Due to computerization we can easily update, deletes or insert the data
of user andhence retrieval of any record that is stored becomes easier.
2. Due to computerization, a lot of time is saved because all the paper work
can be doneon computer with greater accuracy.
3. Changes can be made immediately and efficiently as we require.
4. print- out of updated records can be taken.
5.Due to computerization department can maintain information of all
the questionsand answers easily in the computer itself
 Limitations
To overcome the limitation of the system there are some suggestions1. For user information & according addition of new module isrequired.
 For better accuracy, correctly inputting data is required
